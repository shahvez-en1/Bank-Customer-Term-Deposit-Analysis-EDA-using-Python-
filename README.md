# Bank Customer Term Deposit Analysis (EDA using Python)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* on a bank customer dataset to understand customer behavior and identify key factors that influence *term deposit subscription* decisions.  
The analysis helps in gaining insights useful for banking marketing strategies and customer segmentation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze customer demographic information
- Understand the impact of job, education, age, and balance on term deposit subscription
- Study the effect of marketing campaigns and previous contacts
- Identify patterns that help predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about bank customers, including:
- Age
- Job type
- Marital status
- Education level
- Account balance
- Housing and personal loan status
- Contact duration
- Previous campaign outcome
- Target variable: *Term Deposit Subscription (Yes/No)*

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- *Python*
- *Pandas* – data manipulation
- *NumPy* – numerical operations
- *Matplotlib* – data visualization
- *Seaborn* – statistical visualization
- *Jupyter Notebook*

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Performed
- Age distribution of customers
- Job-wise and education-wise analysis
- Balance vs term deposit subscription
- Contact duration impact on subscription
- Effect of housing and personal loans
- Previous campaign outcome analysis

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Certain job categories show higher likelihood of term deposit subscription
- Longer contact duration increases chances of subscription
- Customers without housing or personal loans are more likely to subscribe
- Education level plays a significant role in customer decisions

---

## 🚀 Conclusion
This EDA project highlights important customer patterns that can help banks optimize their marketing campaigns and target the right customers for term deposit products.

---

## 📌 Future Scope
- Apply machine learning models to predict term deposit subscription
